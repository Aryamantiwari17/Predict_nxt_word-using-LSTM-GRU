# Next Word Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit app that predicts the next word based on the user's input text. The model uses TensorFlow/Keras and a pre-trained tokenizer and LSTM model for next-word prediction.

## Features

- **Next Word Prediction**: Enter any text, and the model will suggest the next likely word.
- **Interactive Streamlit UI**: User-friendly interface for real-time word predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses an LSTM-based model trained on sequential text data for accurate predictions.
